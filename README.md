TODO:<h1>Requirements - Short Answer Questions</h1>

<h2>What are the most important aspects of quality software?</h2>
>There are no one most important aspect. A quality software or application rely on their interconnecting functions, architectural side of the application, and performance of the application that allows the software itself to be maintained, scaled, and improved over time. This allow a healthy relationship where users and development team bond a connection in keeping the software at optimum level.


<h2>What libraries are being used in the app and why?</h2>

<h2>A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?</h2>
>Understanding client "User Stories". and good understanding on what client is currently using, versus expectations with allowed time frame and budget.
>Adopting Agile methodology in aiding the team to complete the project in timely and healthy manner.
>Task assignment within the team to allow function separation in accordance to the project priority to allow completion within time frame.


<h2>Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?</h2>
Standups -
This allow focus and direction within the team.<br/>
Planning, wireframing, design in figma, and updates in trello.<br/>
Go outside your comfort zone. Ask colleaques, teachers or even rubber ducking when facing road blocks.


<h2>Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?</h2>
>Having to complete the first 6 months within Coder Academy, this time round as a team, we felt that we are more prepared conceptually, and able to have a better understanding on how to approach certain task. The course has also made us become a better "googler". 
>Agile methodology is a powerful tool that everyone should be holding on to. It is definitely a tool that is worth looking deeper into to understand how it can be applied once we are in the workforce.
